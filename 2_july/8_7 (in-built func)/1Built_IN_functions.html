jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies client-side scripting of HTML. It provides many built-in functions to make common 
tasks like DOM manipulation, event handling, AJAX calls, and animation easier. Here are some of the commonly used built-in functions in jQuery:

These are just a selection of the many functions jQuery provides to simplify DOM manipulation, event handling, animations, 
AJAX requests, and more. Each function is designed to be intuitive and cross-browser compatible, making it easier to 
develop dynamic and interactive web applications.
